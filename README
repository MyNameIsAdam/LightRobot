The aim of this project is to control a modified 3pi pololu robot using Android's voice controls and gyroscope.
Motivation was to learn some android and arduino programming, as well as having a cool moving lightsource at home :-)

We added 3 RGB LEDs on top of the robot, a bluetooth chip(rn42) and a sonar sensor(srf02) on the front, in order to avoid obstacles when 
moving randomly. 
As you can see in the demo video, it is possible to adjust manually the color settings with the android app, and activate a blink or shine mode.
Also, shining and blinkin in random colors is possible. Regardins voice controls, you can command "shine + color", "blink + color" and "move random", where color are "red, blue and green".
To control the speed and the direction of the robot, we rely on the gyroscope of the smartphones sensor.
